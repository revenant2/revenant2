RevenantÂ² is a quick and simple way to play music using your computer keyboard. Simply visit [revenant2.github.io](https://revenant2.github.io/) and either choose from one of the 17 included sound presets, or upload your own samples in .FLAC, .MP3, or .WAV formats.

## How to Use
A US keyboard layout is recommended. Use the QWERTY and ZXCVBN rows of your keyboard to play white piano keys, and 123456 and ASDFGH to play black keys. Press + or - to increase or decrease the current octave.
